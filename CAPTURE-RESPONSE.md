# TradingView oracle capture handoff

Captured on 2026-10-07 using Chrome MCP, from an isolated temporary checkout. No dependencies were installed and no Tealstreet implementation files were changed. Capture changes are committed and pushed to master at round boundaries.

All 185 authored sources in rounds 49–56 were attempted unchanged. Exact source and instruction SHA256 values match the bundle inventory. Defaults were retained except the explicitly requested independent input/feed attempts. Native compile and runtime refusals are evidence; source repairs were not applied.

| Round | Authored sources | Response | Additional observations |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| 49 | 29 | [Response](v49/RESPONSE.md) | String qualifier consumers |
| 50 | 9 | [Response](v50/RESPONSE.md) | Enum control and primitive tostring consumers |
| 51 | 12 | [Response](v51/RESPONSE.md) | String title refusals and UDT reference-search vectors |
| 52 | 73 | [Response](v52/RESPONSE.md) | Consolidated pending-row admission/refusal queue |
| 53 | 5 | [Response](v53/RESPONSE.md) | [Actual feed events and observer limits](v53/OBSERVATIONS.md) |
| 54 | 47 | [Response](v54/RESPONSE.md) | [Input cases, feed limits, history runtime error and UDT live evidence](v54/OBSERVATIONS.md) |
| 55 | 5 | [Response](v55/RESPONSE.md) | [Map identity and exact numeric join strings](v55/OBSERVATIONS.md) |
| 56 | 5 | [Response](v56/RESPONSE.md) | [Matrix, string and once lifecycle observations](v56/OBSERVATIONS.md) |

Each round has captures/vN/manifest.json with source-bound attempts, outcomes, contexts and artifact hashes. native.json preserves exact editor source, diagnostics, actual plot names, inputs, native status and logs. diagnostic.jpg shows compile/runtime refusals; settings.jpg and data-window.jpg bind successful observations. Live subdirectories retain timestamped receipts, Data Window screenshots and exact logs.

For A/B tests, use the exact source hash and recorded input/chart context. Prefer chart-export.csv where present: it is the original TradingView Download chart data file. chart-export.json attests its download identity/hash. plots.csv is an additional serialization of captured native rows, retaining blank cells, actual columns and CAPTURE_IS_OPEN_BAR. Earlier PlotList captures and separately timed UI export receipts remain distinguishable attempts; never combine their current-price rows by position. Native UI CSV omits chart volume unless the source plots it; do not invent that channel. Native metadata/other capture channels record the available OHLCV context.

Original unbounded runs retain full loaded history and native startup INDEX/SOURCE_INDEX 0..15. Separately timed UI-export receipts may reuse cached mature history; their startupCovered and firstSourceIndex fields state the actual coverage, and they do not replace the original startup evidence. Bounded sources retain the actual calculated range, normally 31 closed plus one live bar at initial attachment. Follow-up confirmed/live receipts are separate attempts. SAMPLE_INDEX is a local pass counter; chartIndex is a renderer/feed index and must not be treated as source bar_index. Use source time/index and the recorded cutoff to align rows.

## Boundaries to keep open

- Signed-zero EMA/RMA observers collapse -0/+0: strings are 0 and zero reciprocals are NaN. The sign-bit question is INCONCLUSIVE.
- Missing-price OHLC events and mature finite-to-missing/recovery neighborhoods were not reached for the implicit-source rows. Finite controls and all-missing-volume DXY observations do not settle those facets.
- DXY establishes actual missing-volume bounded output; SP:SPX resolved to SP_DLY:SPX and had defined volume, so that candidate supplies no missing-input credit.
- Actual positive-volume flat III/WVAD bars and four finite recovery neighbors were reached on DOGEBTC in v6. The v5 facet stays unobserved.
- The -1.5 input history offset compiles then fails at bar 0, line 5, RE10008. The -0.5 and positive controls run; no other qualifier/version result follows.
- Named candidate model columns are observations, never presumed native truth. These receipts authorize bounded A/B comparisons, not full-domain algorithm/precision claims.
- Native CSV volume omissions and other absent channels must stay UNOBSERVED; the source or capture contract can be revised by the author if an additional channel is needed.

Responses use stable filenames alongside each round's handoff. Existing bundle/source version names remain their original identities. Any reply from the receiving agent can go beside these files so the two machines can continue through master.

## Supplemental native CSV receipts

All 69 planned additional UI-download receipts are captured in separately timed *-ui-export attempts. These supplement the complete 185-source inventory; they do not replace the earlier source-bound native rows, logs, diagnostics or screenshots. UI receipt capturedAt uses the downloaded CSV timestamp; metadataCapturedAt retains the preceding editor/settings capture time. Native CSV blanks remain missing values.

The interrupted batch resumed through Chrome MCP on 2026-10-07 after its connection recovered. All 13 remaining attempts ran and now have original CSV downloads, matching named columns, native source/context metadata, settings and Data Window screenshots. No supplemental CSV receipts remain pending. This connection interruption was a capture-tool failure, not a Pine compile/runtime result.

The TSI(3,5) default UI receipt retains samples 0..64 with its last cell live. Its separate confirmed-prefix-ui-export receipt was taken from that same uninterrupted attachment after the next bar: all eligible samples 0..64 are closed, and sample 65 is retained as ineligible context. Source bytes and defaults were unchanged.
