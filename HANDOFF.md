## What these are

Nine Pine v6 indicator scripts, **60 plots each**, written to extract **TradingView's
own computed values as numbers** via chart-data export. 540 oracle values total.

This is the first real oracle this project has had. Every prior "verification" compared
TealScript against TealScript, against documentation, or against another JavaScript
clone of Pine.

## Why these and not real indicators

These scripts call `ta.*` **directly**, so TradingView's engine evaluates the exact
functions under test. We do not need TradingView's built-in indicators or published
community scripts.

It also maximises oracle values per click. TradingView caps plots at 64 per indicator,
so each script is packed to 60. A built-in indicator spends one indicator slot for ~3
series; these spend one slot for 60.

## Capture procedure

For each script: paste into Pine Editor → Add to Chart → export chart data as CSV.

**If a script fails to compile, STOP and report the exact error.** That is itself a
finding — it means we accept Pine that TradingView rejects, which is compiler evidence
we have never had.

**Verify every export before moving on:**

1. `input_bar_index` starts at **0**
2. **All 60 columns are present.** The OHLCV inputs are plotted into the data window
   deliberately so the CSV is self-contained and we can replay identical bars. A CSV
   missing its input columns is unusable.
3. Enough rows for that script's requirement below — several probes key their `na`
   holes to fixed bar indices and need rows through recovery.

## The nine scripts and their chart requirements

| Script                    | Probes                                                                                                                                                            | Chart requirement                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `na-holes-crosses-v1`     | crossover, crossunder, cross, rising, falling, change, barssince, valuewhen — clean / na-at-start / na interior hole, with holes injected into A and B separately | bar_index **0–127**                                               |
| `na-holes-oscillators-v1` | rsi, stoch, bb, bbw, kc, kcw, cci, cmo, wpr with injected holes                                                                                                   | index **0 → 80+** (holes at 40–41, needs recovery)                |
| `warmup-seed-ma-v1`       | sma, ema, rma, wma, vwma, swma, alma, hma, linreg across lengths including 1 and 2                                                                                | phases **−5 → ≥91**, prefer **159**; holes at 1, 2, 40, 41, 80–85 |
| `rma-chain-v1`            | rma → atr → rsi bar by bar, six gap regimes                                                                                                                       | index **0 → ≥109** so seeded ATR/RSI replay exactly               |
| `extrema-barsago-v1`      | highest, lowest, highestbars, lowestbars, pivothigh, pivotlow, hand-built Aroon — sign and offset convention                                                      | **192 bars**                                                      |
| `volume-vwap-v1`          | vwap, obv, pvt, nvi, pvi, accdist, mfi, cum — 20 MFI and 14 anchored-VWAP probes                                                                                  | index **0**, **≥100 bars**; replay rejects truncated history      |
| `plot-offset-visual-v1`   | plot offset — const and input, positive and negative                                                                                                              | leave the **Shift input at 3**                                    |
| `htf-request-security-v1` | request.security at HTF 6/10/30, lookahead on/off, gaps on/off, security_lower_tf                                                                                 | **2-minute chart**                                                |
| `history-maxbarsback-v1`  | history operator depth, max_bars_back, var/varip as series                                                                                                        | **1800+ bars**; reload before comparing historical varip          |

Premium allows 25 indicators per chart, so all nine fit in **two charts**: the seven
"any symbol" scripts on one chart with 1800+ bars loaded, and `htf-request-security`
plus `plot-offset-visual` on a 2-minute chart.

## Where the expected values live

The committed [capture set v1](captures/v1/README-v1.md) contains eight raw
TradingView CSVs plus the exact runtime error from the unchanged
`warmup-seed-ma-v1` probe. Its manifest records source/export hashes, chart
context, column order and historical comparison cutoffs. Sam explicitly requested
this capture set be committed for replay on another machine; the companion
predictions and harnesses remain in the archive below.

Each script has a companion `<name>-v1.md` in
`~/cs/docs/tealscript-parity-archive/oracle-probes/` carrying, per column: what it
tests, TealScript's **current** value, and a **prediction** of agree/disagree that was
frozen **before any export existed**.

Those predictions are on the record deliberately. A wrong prediction is the most
informative outcome available — do not quietly discard one.

Replay and diff harnesses already exist alongside those files. Use them rather than
writing new ones.

## Rules for whoever processes the CSVs

Every one of these was learned at cost on this work.

- **A disagreement is a finding to REPORT, not to fix.** Do not touch the runtime, a
  vector, or an expectation. Report the column, bar index, both values and the delta,
  and stop.
- **Never adjust a prediction or an expectation to match the oracle.** If TealScript
  disagrees with TradingView, TealScript is probably wrong — but establish which,
  against documentation, before anyone changes code. A suite that was quietly tuned to
  agree with its own engine is exactly the failure this project is unwinding.
- **Verify column alignment first, never assume it.** `plot(offset)` shifts a series,
  so a shifted column does not line up with raw rows. Each script includes primitive
  controls specifically to distinguish shifted from raw — confirm the controls agree
  before trusting anything else in that file.
- **Establish export precision before calling a 1e-9 difference a defect.**
- **A clean agreement is a real result.** It converts TRACE-REQUIRED into
  DOCUMENTED-VERIFIED, which is the whole point of the exercise.
- **Suspect the instrument before the engine.** A whole column or whole family
  disagreeing uniformly is more likely a misread column, a chart-setting mismatch, or a
  bar-alignment error than a uniform engine defect. That has been a false headline six
  times on this work.
- **A definition difference is not a defect.** TA-Lib's CMO is Wilder-smoothed; Tulip
  rounds HMA's `sqrt` differently at N=3 and N=7; a signed-flow MFI formula is not
  Pine's MFI contract. Only score a disagreement when both sides compute the **same
  documented thing**.

## Scope

**Drawn indicators only.** Strategies, backtesting, orders, fills, commission and
margin are explicitly out of scope.

## What this capture cannot settle

- **Appearance.** Colour, style and linewidth are not exportable — only values, plus
  `offset` because it shifts the series.
- **Builtins with implicit OHLC.** `ta.wpr(length)` takes no source argument, so native
  Pine cannot inject an `na` hole into it. The script carries a clean builtin control
  plus formula-based hole probes, which cannot close the builtin's own hole policy.
- **Series offsets under v6.** Not compilable; documented and excluded.

## Supporting material (not committed — too large / generated)

In `~/cs/docs/tealscript-parity-archive/`:

- `oracle-probes/` — per-script column keys, frozen predictions, measured TealScript
  baselines, CSV replay and diff harnesses
- `reference/pine-v6-reference-v1.json` — all **1,446** official v6 reference entries,
  472 with remarks, 639 with examples. Remarks carry the load-bearing edge-case rules.
  Check this before declaring anything undocumented: several items the archive calls
  TRACE-REQUIRED turn out to be specified there.
- `ledger/` — the parity denominator, per surface, with an oracle status per item
- `ta-verify/` — `ta.*` family verification against published formulas and non-JS
  independent libraries

## Then round v35 — color and plot type boundaries v1

Capture the 15 indicator-only scripts in [v35/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v35/bundle-manifest-v1.json) order, following [HANDOFF-v35-v1.md](v35/HANDOFF-v35-v1.md) and the per-script instructions. Fourteen exact substitutions discriminate documented type admission; one missing-gradient-endpoint probe preserves the original call and exports color channels/NA flags. Native outcomes are unspecified: retain exact first diagnostics, third outcomes, raw CSV and screenshots without repairing sources. Return to `v35/captures/v35/RESPONSE-v35.md`. Verify `v35/SHA256SUMS` before capture.

## Then round v38

Capture the five PyneCore/native discriminators in [v38/HANDOFF-v38-v1.md](v38/HANDOFF-v38-v1.md). Follow each per-script instruction, preserve INDEX=0..239 and source/CSV hashes, and return `v38/captures/v38/RESPONSE-v38.md`. Native outcomes are unspecified.

## Then round v34 — TA-D admission v1

Capture the five independent sources in [v34/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v34/bundle-manifest-v1.json), following [HANDOFF-v34-v1.md](v34/HANDOFF-v34-v1.md) and per-script instructions. Native outcomes are unspecified. Verify v34/SHA256SUMS and return exact diagnostics or raw CSV to v34/captures/v34/RESPONSE-v34.md.
## Then round v39 — global request operand version boundaries v1

Capture the nine indicator-only sources in [v39/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v39/bundle-manifest-v1.json) order, following [HANDOFF-v39-v1.md](v39/HANDOFF-v39-v1.md) and each per-script instruction. Six isolated ternary/and/or probes compare v5/v6 with dynamic_requests=false; three v6 true companions control source/context validity. Native compile/refusal outcomes are unspecified. Preserve exact source bytes and earliest diagnostics; export VALUE and CONTROL_CLOSE when a source runs. Return `v39/captures/v39/RESPONSE-v39.md` and verify `v39/SHA256SUMS` before capture.

## Then round v40 — unresolved string boundaries v1

Capture the nine independent scripts in [v40/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v40/bundle-manifest-v1.json) order, following [HANDOFF-v40-v1.md](v40/HANDOFF-v40-v1.md) and each literal instruction path. Eight literal witnesses discriminate exponent/whitespace conversion, negative/reversed substring bounds, empty-target replacement, apostrophe escaping, integer zero padding and percent formatting; the ninth is a valid-call companion. Native phases/values are unspecified. Export candidate flags and missing masks, copy exact Pine Logs text and record earliest refusals without repairing sources. Return source-bound artifacts to `v40/captures/v40/RESPONSE-v40.md`. Check `v40/SHA256SUMS` before capture.

## Then round v41 — math.round authority conflicts v1

Capture the three independent sources in [v41/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v41/bundle-manifest-v1.json) order, following [HANDOFF-v41-v1.md](v41/HANDOFF-v41-v1.md) and per-script instructions. Two qualifier consumers and one exact negative-half numeric probe preserve the conflicting authorities without predicting native outcomes. Keep source bytes/defaults unchanged; return full earliest refusals or raw named columns to `v41/captures/v41/RESPONSE-v41.md`. Verify `v41/SHA256SUMS` before capture.

## Then round v43

Capture the five TA-C discriminators in v43/bundle-manifest-v1.json using v43/HANDOFF-v43-v1.md and its literal per-source instructions. Native outcomes are unspecified; return source-hash-bound evidence under v43/captures/v43/RESPONSE-v43.md.

## Then round v46 — Rising re-adjudication v1

Capture the three independent sources in [v46/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v46/bundle-manifest-v1.json), following [HANDOFF-v46-v1.md](v46/HANDOFF-v46-v1.md) and per-script instructions. Compare native Rising with both explicitly labelled candidate models; neither is an expected outcome. Preserve INDEX/PHASE/source controls, exact diagnostics, all CSV columns and source/capture hashes. Verify v46/SHA256SUMS; return to v46/captures/v46/RESPONSE-v46.md.

## Then round v44 — math.max NA arguments and enum defaults v1

Capture the seven independent scripts in [v44/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v44/bundle-manifest-v1.json) order, following [HANDOFF-v44-v1.md](v44/HANDOFF-v44-v1.md) and each per-script instruction. Two int/float math.max matrices cover all three-argument NA masks and pair/order controls; five enum sources isolate missing initialization, history, array defaults, conditional defaults and input defaults. Native outcomes are unspecified. Preserve raw CSV, NA flags, INDEX=0 startup rows, settings and exact earliest refusals without repairing sources. Verify `v44/SHA256SUMS` and return `v44/captures/v44/RESPONSE-v44.md`.

## Then round v47 — string arity, delayed bounds and return qualifier reuse v3

Capture the 7 independent scripts in [v47/bundle-manifest-v3.json](v47/bundle-manifest-v3.json), following [HANDOFF-v47-v3.md](v47/HANDOFF-v47-v3.md) and each per-source instruction. Four sources isolate format-only and omitted-time calls; two add delayed series bounds to existing literal v40 substring probes; one valid-call companion stays separate. The parked return-qualifier question reuses v42 const/simple/input consumers; hashes are recorded, with no duplicate scripts. Native phases/values are UNSPECIFIED. Preserve earliest diagnostics, exact raw text logs, CSV/INDEX/time context and screenshots. Check v47/SHA256SUMS and return v47/captures/v47/RESPONSE-v47.md.
## Then round v42 — string unions and scalar qualifier consumers v1

Capture the 34 independent indicators in [v42/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v42/bundle-manifest-v1.json) order, using [HANDOFF-v42-v1.md](v42/HANDOFF-v42-v1.md) and each literal per-script instruction path. Nine formatted tostring probes cover bool/string/enum and their arrays/matrices, five cover matrix/enum format admission, and 20 isolate scalar consumer boundaries. Native compile/runtime phase and values are unspecified. Preserve complete qualified diagnostics and raw text; a refusal without an actual qualified type cannot alone distinguish input from simple. Return source-bound artifacts under `v42/captures/v42/RESPONSE-v42.md`. Verify `v42/SHA256SUMS` before capture.

> **Then round v45.** Capture [v45/HANDOFF-v45-v1.md](v45/HANDOFF-v45-v1.md) — four sources for zero-MAD CCI, zero-denominator COG, zero-variance correlation and live barssince rollback; reuse the pinned v29/v32 sources in place. Reply at `v45/captures/v45/RESPONSE-v45.md`.

## Then round v48 — switch key and UDF once state v1

Capture the two independent indicators in [v48/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v48/bundle-manifest-v1.json) order using [HANDOFF-v48-v1.md](v48/HANDOFF-v48-v1.md) and each per-source instruction. Native outcomes are unspecified: one probe counts UDF switch-key evaluations with a variable-key control; the other observes once activation across two written UDF calls. Preserve raw CSV, startup INDEX 0..15, closed/realtime identity and exact earliest refusals. Check v48/SHA256SUMS and return v48/captures/v48/RESPONSE-v48.md.

## Then round v49 — native-held scalar and predicate qualifiers v2

Capture the 29 isolated entries in [v49/bundle-manifest-v2.json](v49/bundle-manifest-v2.json), following [HANDOFF-v49-v2.md](v49/HANDOFF-v49-v2.md) and each per-source v49 instruction. Twenty-four new sources add independent active/simple consumers and controls; five reuse exact v42 title/simple/width sources. They discriminate str.match and str.format_time floors, input str.length/pos results and input contains/startswith/endswith results. Native outcomes are UNSPECIFIED: retain full actual/required qualified diagnostics, raw CSV/text and unchanged defaults. Verify v49/SHA256SUMS and return source-bound attempts to v49/captures/v49/RESPONSE-v49.md.

## Then round v50 — one-argument tostring primitive and enum qualifiers v1

Capture the nine isolated consumers in [v50/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v50/bundle-manifest-v1.json), following [HANDOFF-v50-v1.md](v50/HANDOFF-v50-v1.md) and each per-source instruction. Capture the const-enum control first; eight primitive const/input consumers then distinguish the one-argument str.tostring title boundary. Native outcomes are UNSPECIFIED. Preserve complete actual/required qualified diagnostics, exact dynamic titles, CSV/SOURCE_INDEX and unchanged defaults without repairing refusals. Verify v50/SHA256SUMS and return source-bound attempts to v50/captures/v50/RESPONSE-v50.md.

## Then round v51 — input string qualifiers and UDT search comparators v1

Capture the twelve isolated indicators in [v51/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v51/bundle-manifest-v1.json), following [HANDOFF-v51-v1.md](v51/HANDOFF-v51-v1.md) and each literal per-source instruction. Nine input lower/upper/substring/replace consumers require full actual/required qualified title diagnostics; three UDT indexof/lastindexof/includes probes distinguish reference identity from equal field values before and after mutation. Native outcomes are UNSPECIFIED; retain OTHER/refusal outcomes and source bytes unchanged. Verify v51/SHA256SUMS and return source-bound evidence to v51/captures/v51/RESPONSE-v51.md.

## Then round v52 — consolidated native-pending register rows v1

Capture the 73 isolated indicators in [v52/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v52/bundle-manifest-v1.json), following [HANDOFF-v52-v1.md](v52/HANDOFF-v52-v1.md) and each literal instruction path. They cover 34 distinct rows: all 26 open v21 rows plus eight supplementary native holds. Each source targets one row; refusal-prone union kinds and qualifier consumers remain isolated. Native phase/values are UNSPECIFIED, and TA entries establish only parameter admission. Retain exact qualified diagnostics, raw text/CSV/screenshots and context; observe 32 closed bars. Verify v52/SHA256SUMS and return v52/captures/v52/RESPONSE-v52.md.

## Then round v53 — supplementary singleton/flat/missing TA boundaries v1

Capture the five bounded v6 indicators in [v53/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v53/bundle-manifest-v1.json), using [HANDOFF-v53-v1.md](v53/HANDOFF-v53-v1.md) and each per-source instruction. They cover only five supplementary rows absent from v52. Preserve exact signed-zero strings and separate reciprocals, actual native flat/missing OHLCV masks and recovery neighbors; an absent event is INCONCLUSIVE. Native outcomes are UNSPECIFIED, and the III/WVAD v5 facet remains unobserved. Verify v53/SHA256SUMS; return v53/captures/v53/RESPONSE-v53.md.

## Then round v54 — new formula and missing-state boundaries v1

Capture the 47 isolated sources in [v54/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v54/bundle-manifest-v1.json), using [HANDOFF-v54-v1.md](v54/HANDOFF-v54-v1.md) and each per-source instruction. One source per new row; v53 facets are unchanged. Preserve actual implicit-OHLC hole eligibility, deterministic source/control cells, earliest diagnostic phase and masks; absent events remain INCONCLUSIVE. Native outcomes are UNSPECIFIED. Verify v54/SHA256SUMS and return source-bound evidence to v54/captures/v54/RESPONSE-v54.md.

## Then round v55 — map key identity boundaries v1

Capture the five bounded indicators in [v55/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v55/bundle-manifest-v1.json), using [HANDOFF-v55-v1.md](v55/HANDOFF-v55-v1.md) and per-source instructions. Missing-key repeated identity, literal signed-zero overwrite/removal and exact Unicode normalization/insertion-order cells stay isolated. All DEFECT_REGISTER_v28 native-pending rows already have v52/v53/v54 sources, so no register probes are duplicated. Separate v5/v6 numeric array.join probes retain exact logged strings and fractional/default controls. Native outcomes remain UNSPECIFIED. Preserve source UTF-8, raw blanks/zeros, diagnostics and context. Verify v55/SHA256SUMS; return v55/captures/v55/RESPONSE-v55.md.

## Then round v56 — matrix predicate/order and language return/live boundaries v1

Capture the five indicators in [v56/bundle-manifest-v1.json](v56/bundle-manifest-v1.json), using [HANDOFF-v56-v1.md](v56/HANDOFF-v56-v1.md) and each exact instruction. Two matrix fixtures and separate v5/v6 no-match string sources use bounded historical CSV; the once source requires a continuous open/close/next-bar live sequence. All46 v31 native-pending rows already map to v52-v55; reuse existing questions without duplicate probes. Native phase/values are UNSPECIFIED. Preserve source hashes, raw blanks/zeros, exact diagnostics and live logs/context; insufficient live events remain HELD. Verify v56/SHA256SUMS; return v56/captures/v56/RESPONSE-v56.md.
